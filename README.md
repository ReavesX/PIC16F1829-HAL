# PIC16F1829 HAL  
This repository contains a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the PIC16F1829 microcontroller.  
The HAL provides a clean and reusable API for GPIO, UART, Timers, and PWM peripherals.  

## Features  
- Simplifies peripheral programming  
- Promotes reusable code  
- Designed for PIC16F1829 but extendable to other PIC MCUs  

## Getting Started  
Check the `docs/Getting_Started.md` file for setup instructions.
